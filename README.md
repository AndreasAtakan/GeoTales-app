# GeoTales-app

This repository contains the source-code for the GeoTales mobile app.
The app automatically creates interactive travel logs with a map-visualisation of the geographic path taken based on the GPS EXIF data of the images stored on the device. These travel logs are meant as fun ways to present our travels for tourists, backpackers, globetrotters and the like.
